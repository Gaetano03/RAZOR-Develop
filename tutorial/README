#SingleMODES
Applies one particular Model Reduction technique to an unsteady aerodynamic problem to extract flow primitives (modes) that 
can be used for fluid dynamics analysis or flow reconstruction inside the sampling time interval outside the training points.

#AdaptiveMODES
Compute the flow reconstruction at the desired time instants inside the sampling interval combining together the bases coming from 
different Model Reduction techniques. More global basis are defined over the sampling interval and, at each desired time for 
reconstruction, the one which guarantees the less error is chosen.
